This was the comitition conducted by pickel.AI company in which we secure rank 1
In this i got a datset in which i have to create a model to decide a bank to approve a loan or not
In this dataset i have done some basic statistical insight than visualization after that i have done feature selection to decide the important fetaure to be used for further going and dropped irrelevant columns
Than i  saw that the data is imbalanced so i did oversampling to balance the dependent features
than i have done cross validation to decide which model are doing best - so randomforest and xgboost were performing better
so after than i have done hyperparameter tunning on both of them to decide the best parameters
and done the prediction
